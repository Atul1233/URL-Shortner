# URL-Shortner (Django)
Website in Django.URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.  Some websites prevent short, redirected URLs from being posted.
